# Electra

Electra is a fork of Min, which is an experiment to enforce more humane web design. This browser is NOT designed to be a daily driver.

How, you may ask? Old internet might has been good for many reasons. Of course, I am not arguing over the modern web development issues, because right now we (users) and web developers have lots of conveniences.
Though, some of them were used in malicious ways by big tech companies:
- Tracking scripts
- Gigantic pages full of ever-executing content
- Unnecessary client-sided API calls
- Something that I forgot to mention
Here, I'll take inspiration from Gemini network protocol, and will hang some personalization on it, but will still give priority to the text content for great readability and low network bandwidth.

Min, the base browser used for this experiment, is a fast, minimal browser that protects your privacy. It includes an interface designed to minimize distractions, and features such as:

- Full-text search for visited pages
- Ad and tracker blocking
- Automatic reader view
- Tasks (tab groups)
- Bookmark tagging
- Password manager integration
- Dark theme

As this is an experiment, thus, it is not a project that's planned to be worked on or maintained for long.
Check out Min instead:

Download Min from the [releases page](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/releases), or learn more on the [website](https://minbrowser.org/).
