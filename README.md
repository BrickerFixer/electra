# Electra

Electra is a fork of Min, which is an experiment to enforce more humane web design towards big tech.

Min is a fast, minimal browser that protects your privacy. It includes an interface designed to minimize distractions, and features such as:

- Full-text search for visited pages
- Ad and tracker blocking
- Automatic reader view
- Tasks (tab groups)
- Bookmark tagging
- Password manager integration
- Dark theme

This is an experiment, thus, it is not a project that's planned to be worked on or maintained for long.
Check out Min instead:

Download Min from the [releases page](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/releases), or learn more on the [website](https://minbrowser.org/).
